This is the data generated from the Java simulations for up to 1,000,000 million packets, using increments of 10,000 with 50 trials per increment. The cost of a collision was log_2(n) for whatever n was in the current trial (10,000 then 20,000 then etc.).

Note that these experiments will take a long time to run.
